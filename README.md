##Use Deep Learning to build a simple calculator, include Adder, Subtractor and the Combination.
##I use jupyter notebook to write the code as well as some explanation.
## File:
- Neural_Adder.ipynb: Adder
- Neural_Subtractor.ipynb: Subtractor
- Neural_Combine.ipynb: Combination of Adder and Subtractor
